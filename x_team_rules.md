# X-Team 74 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* There is a website called Trello that helps track and assign tasks. At the start of the assignment, we will meet up and create the trello board and assign tasks and due dates to each member.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* We can use Trello's feature of setting due dates and planning out steps. After each task is done, we will also notify in the group chat that the specified task is complete.
* We can use Trello to track what needs to be done, what is being worked on, and what has been completed.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* We can use Canvas to make an announcment to the whole group to ask for help or notify that it will take longer than expected.
* We also have a group chat to message everyone about any questions of conflicts we have with the assigned task.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* If we start assignments early we should be able to tell if we can complete it by the deadline, or if we need help
* We shouldn't be afraid to ask eachother for help.

## How we will schedule meetings
* We have made a group chat over text which makes communicating nearly instant. If we feel a meeting needs to be held then someone will ask in the chat. From there we will agree on a time and meeting place. Meetings will only take place if everyone can attend.
